## About Assignment Tracker 

This project was created using the mern stack (mongodb, express, react, node) and it also used redux. Users can create an account, login, logout, and add assignments with their corresponding due dates. Passwords are encrypted and saved to the mongodb database. Users are also issued tokens and can access certain routes only if they have the token. 

This is my first time combining node/express and react so if there are any issues or vulnerabilities in my code please reach out to me, my contact is below, thanks in advance!

I deployed this project using Render.com.
